3 Observale Trends:
  1. Urban areas will typically have more residents and tourists, resulting in Urban areas far exceeding Suburban and Rural areas in percentage of total fares, percentage of total rides, and percentage of drivers.
  2. Rural areas by far had the least amount of drivers by city type. However, there % of total fares is more than 200% higher than the driver count. My theory on this is that rides are longer in rural areas because they're less condensed than Suburban and Urban areas. Also, please see observation #3.
  3. Since drivers are in less supply/more demand in rural areas, the average fare is predominantly higher. Inversely, since drivers are in more supply/less demand in urban areas, the average fare is lower. Suburban rides find themselves right in the middle.
